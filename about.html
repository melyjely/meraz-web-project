                <h2>About Deadline Tattoo Company</h2>

                <p>
                    Our tattoo company was founded by our beloved artist Alix Rodriguez. Alix sought to create a studio that welcomed those on the fringes of identity whether they are looking to get tattooed or to tattoo others. After she finished her apprenticeship, Alix saved up in order to open her own studio. While working in Joliet, Illinois she met Tamara and Autumn and they quickly forged a bond over the art of tattooing. One night they all decided to pool their savings together to open Deadline Tattoo Company and the shop has been open for 3 years now.
                </p>
